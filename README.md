First Android Application

A simple application that displays and says the phrase "Hello World" in 5 languages

I downloaded the audio files from Google Translate for the 5 languages available in the app. In order to play the sound when the button is pressed, I used the MediaPlayer feature in Android Studio. The button will play the audio file associated with the language and change the main TextView to reflect that language.
